# View the events that trigger the configuration change of a resource

Cloud Config integrates with ActionTrail. You can view the configuration before and after the 10-minute interval at which Cloud Config detects a configuration change, the events that trigger the change, and event details in Cloud Config. The details of an event include the user who triggered the event, source IP address, the time when the event occurred, and the API operation called in this event.

You can also log on to the [ActionTrail console](https://actiontrail.console.aliyun.com) to view the events that trigger the configuration change.
