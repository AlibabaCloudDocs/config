# Authorize Cloud Config to access your resources

You must authorize Cloud Config to access your resources before you can use it to track configuration changes of your resources and evaluate configuration compliance.

Make sure that you have completed [account registration](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm) and [real-name verification](https://account-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/intlAuth) with Alibaba Cloud.

When you authorize Cloud Config to access data in other Alibaba Cloud services, the running of these services is not affected. Only the read-only permissions on resource configurations are granted to Cloud Config.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the Authorize step, click **Allow** to create the service linked role that authorizes Cloud Config to access your resources.

    **Note:** Cloud Config needs 2 to 10 minutes to scan your resources and generate a resource list.
