# StartConfigurationRecorder

Enables Cloud Config to monitor the resources of your Alibaba Cloud account.

The difference between using a normal account or an enterprise management account to call this interface is as follows:

-   If you are a normal account, you can call this interface to open Cloud Config Service for the current account. You can view resources for your current account and manage compliance rules for your current account.
-   If you are the enterprise management account of Resource Directory and you set parameter `EnterpriseeEdition` to `true` when invoking the interface, Cloud Config Service can be enabled for all member accounts. You can view resources for all member accounts in the Account Group and manage compliance rules for all member accounts.

This article will provide an example of using a common account to open the Cloud Config service and monitor the resources of the current account.
