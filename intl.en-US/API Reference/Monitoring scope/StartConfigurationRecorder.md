# StartConfigurationRecorder

Enables Cloud Config to monitor the resources of your Alibaba Cloud account.

Ordinary accounts and management accounts have the following differences when you use them to call the StartConfigurationRecorder operation:

-   If you are using an ordinary account, you can call the StartConfigurationRecorder operation to activate Cloud Config for the current account. You can also view the resources of the current account and manage the compliance rules of the current account.
-   If you are using the management account of a resource directory and set the `EnterpriseEdition` parameter to `true`, you can activate Cloud Config for all member accounts. In addition, a global account group that includes all member accounts is created by default. You can view the resources of all member accounts in the account group and manage the compliance rules of all member accounts.

In this topic, an ordinary account is used as an example to show how to activate Cloud Config and monitor the resources of the current account.
