# Manage compliance packages in an account group

The compliance packages that are created in an account group belong to the account group and take effect on the resources of all member accounts in the account group.

A management account is used to log on to the Cloud Config console.

When you create a compliance package for a single Alibaba Cloud account or in an account group, managed rules cannot be automatically remediated.

If you view the compliance package details in an account group, you can view the compliance status of resources by filtering rules or accounts. If you view the compliance package details in a single account, you can view the compliance status of resources only by filtering rules.
