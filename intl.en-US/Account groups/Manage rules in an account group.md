# Manage rules in an account group

The rules that are created in an account group belong to the account group and take effect on the resources of all member accounts in the account group.

A management account is used to log on to the Cloud Config console.

Whether you create a compliance package for a single Alibaba Cloud account or in an account group, managed rules can be automatically remediated.
