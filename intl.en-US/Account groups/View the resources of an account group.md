# View the resources of an account group

A management account can view the resources of all member accounts in an account group across regions. You can filter or search for specific resources in the account group and view the configuration information of the resources. A management account can also go to the Alibaba Cloud Management Console to manage its own resources. However, a management account cannot manage resources of member accounts.

A management account is used to log on to the Cloud Config console.

-   A management account can view the configuration details, configuration timeline, compliance timeline, and associated resources of a member account in an account group.
-   If a management account adds a member account to multiple account groups, the resources of the member account are displayed in the resource list of each account group.
-   If a management account creates different rules for multiple account groups, the compliance evaluation results and compliance timelines of resources in the account groups are different. Even if the member accounts and resources in the account groups are the same, the compliance evaluation results, associated rules, and compliance timelines of resources are still different.
