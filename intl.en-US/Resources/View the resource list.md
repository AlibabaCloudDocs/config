# View the resource list

After you authorize Cloud Config to access your resources, you can view the resources that reside in different regions in the Cloud Config console. You can also search for a resource and view the details of the resource.

Cloud Config supports only some Alibaba Cloud services. Therefore, the resource list displays only part of your resources. Cloud Config will support more Alibaba Cloud services and display more resources in the resource list soon. For more information about the resource types that Cloud Config supports, see [Resource types supported by Cloud Config](/intl.en-US/Resource monitoring scope/Resource types supported by Cloud Config.md).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resources**.
