# Overview

After you authorize Cloud Config to access your resources, you can view the resources that reside in different regions within your account in the Cloud Config console. You can set filter conditions or enter a resource ID to search for the specified resource and view information about the resource. You can also go to the cloud service console of the resource from the Cloud Config console to manage the resource. Cloud Config continuously tracks and records the changes to the resource. By default, Cloud Config retains the configuration change history of the resource for 10 years. You can view the configuration change history of the resource by using the Cloud Config console or by calling the Cloud Config API.
