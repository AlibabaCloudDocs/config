# Search for resources

This topic describes how to search for resources under your Alibaba Cloud account. If your resources reside in different regions, you must specify the region of a resource before you can find the resource. Cloud Config displays your resources that reside in each region. You can view and manage the resources on the Resources page.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resources**.

3.  On the **Resources** page, filter the resources by resource type, region, compliance status and resource status. Alternatively, enter a resource ID in the search box to search for the specified resource.
