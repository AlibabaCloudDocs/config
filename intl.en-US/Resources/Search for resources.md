# Search for resources

It is difficult to search for a resource if you deploy resources in multiple regions on Alibaba Cloud. You must specify the region where the required resource resides before you can find the resource. Cloud Config displays all your resources in a list, regardless of the region where each resource resides. This way, you can centrally manage your resources.

## Use an ordinary account

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resources**.

3.  On the **Resources** page, set filter conditions or enter a resource ID to search for the specified resource. You can filter resources based on the resource type, region, compliance status, and resource status.
