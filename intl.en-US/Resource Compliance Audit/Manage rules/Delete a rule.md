# Delete a rule

You can delete a rule that you no longer need. After you delete the rule, Cloud Config for Enterprise deletes the configuration of the rule.

The rule that you want to delete is disabled. For more information, see [Disable a rule](/intl.en-US/Resource Compliance Audit/Manage rules/Disable a rule.md).

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Rules**.

3.  On the **Rules** page, filter the rules in the **Inactive** state.

4.  Delete one or more rules as required.

    -   To delete a single rule, perform the following steps:
        1.  On the Rules page, find the rule that you want to delete, move the pointer over the ![More icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3060019951/p93049.png) icon in the **Actions** column, and then select **Delete**.
        2.  **Are you sure you want to delete the rule?** dialog box, click **Disable and Delete**.
    -   To delete multiple rules at a time, perform the following steps:
        1.  Select the check boxes of the rules that you want to delete and click the ![Delete](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3471333061/p170205.png) icon.
        2.  In the Delete Selected Rules message, click **OK**.
5.  Verify that the rule is deleted.

    After you delete a rule, it is no longer displayed on the **Rules** page.
