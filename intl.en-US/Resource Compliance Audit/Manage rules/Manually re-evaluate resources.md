# Manually re-evaluate resources

This topic describes how to manually re-evaluate resources. After you modify a rule in the Cloud Config console, you can manually re-evaluate resources if you want to immediately view the latest compliance evaluation result. If you do not manually re-evaluate the resources, you can view the compliance evaluation result only after resource configurations are changed or the associated rule is triggered at the scheduled time.

The rule that you want to use to re-evaluate resources is in the **Active** state in the **Status** column.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Rules**.

3.  On the **Rules** page, set the filters to find the specific rule.

4.  Click the rule ID in the **Rule Name/Rule ID** column or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.

5.  On the **Rule Details** tab, click **Re-evaluate** in the upper-right corner.
