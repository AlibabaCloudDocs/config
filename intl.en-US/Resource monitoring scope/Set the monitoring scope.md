# Set the monitoring scope

By default, Cloud Config monitors all supported types of resources that belong to your Alibaba Cloud account. During initialization, Cloud Config scans all the resources. If you have other monitoring solutions, perform the following steps to specify the types of resources to be monitored by Cloud Config.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Settings** \> **Monitoring Scope**.

3.  On the **Monitoring Scope** page, click the **Edit** icon in the upper-right corner.

4.  Specify the types of resources to be monitored.

    -   If you select **All Supported Resource Types**, Cloud Config monitors all supported types of resources that belong to your Alibaba Cloud account. If a new service is integrated with Cloud Config, the resource type of the service is automatically added to the monitoring scope.
    -   If you select **Custom Resource Types**, you can specify the types of resources to be monitored. In this case, Cloud Config monitors only the specified types of resources that belong to your Alibaba Cloud account.
5.  Click **OK**.
