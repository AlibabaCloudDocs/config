# Overview

Cloud Config for Enterprise evaluates resource compliance in a continuous and automatic manner. It sends notifications of resource change events, resource non-compliance events, and resource snapshot delivery events to a specified topic of Message Service \(MNS\). This allows you to monitor the changes and compliance of your cloud resources at the earliest opportunity.

The following table describes the types of events that are supported by Cloud Config for Enterprise.
