# View the details of a rule

After you create a rule by using the master account, the rule applies to all member accounts. On the Rules page, you can click a member account from the left directory tree to view the active rules and compliance evaluation results. A member account has only permissions to view the rules and compliance evaluation results of the member account.

You cannot use a member account to create, modify, or delete rules in Cloud Config for Enterprise. However, you can use a member account to view the rules that apply to the member account.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config for Enterprise console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Rules**.

3.  Filter rules and find the rule that you want to view.

4.  Click the rule ID in the **Rule Name/Rule ID** column or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.

    You can view the rule details in the **Basic Information**, **Trigger**, and **Compliance Result for Related Resources** sections.
