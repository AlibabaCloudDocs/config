# Disable a rule

This topic describes how to disable a rule. You can disable a rule if you do not temporarily need it.

-   The master account is used to log on to the Cloud Config for Enterprise console.
-   The status of the rule that you want to disable is **Active** in the **Status** column.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config for Enterprise console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Rules**.

3.  On the **Rules** page, find the rule that you want to disable, move the pointer over the ![More icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3060019951/p93049.png) icon in the **Actions** column, and then select **Disable Rule**.

4.  In the **Are you sure you want to terminate the rule?** message, click **OK**.

    After you click **OK**, the rule that applied to all member accounts no longer applies to the member accounts.

5.  View the status of the rule.

    On the **Rules** page, set filters to search for the rule and verify that the rule is in the **Inactive** state.


To enable a rule that is in the **Inactive** state, find the rule, move the pointer over the ![More icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3060019951/p93049.png) icon in the **Actions** column, and then select **Enable Rule**. After you enable the rule, it enters the **Active** state.
