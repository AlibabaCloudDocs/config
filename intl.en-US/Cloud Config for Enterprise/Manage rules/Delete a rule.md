# Delete a rule

You can delete a rule that you no longer need. After you delete the rule, Cloud Config for Enterprise deletes the configuration of the rule.

-   The master account is used to log on to the Cloud Config for Enterprise console.
-   The rule that you want to delete is disabled. For more information, see [Disable a rule](/intl.en-US/Cloud Config for Enterprise/Manage rules/Disable a rule.md).

**Note:** After the rule that applies to all member accounts is deleted, the rule is deleted for the member accounts.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Config for Enterprise console](https://config.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Rules**.

3.  On the **Rules** page, filter the rules in the **Inactive** state.

4.  Delete one or more rules as required.

    -   To delete a single rule, perform the following steps:
        1.  On the Rules page, find the rule that you want to delete, move the pointer over the ![More icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3060019951/p93049.png) icon in the **Actions** column, and then select **Delete**.
        2.  In the **Are you sure you want to delete the rule?** dialog box, click **Disable and Delete**.
    -   To delete multiple rules at a time, perform the following steps:
        1.  Select the check boxes of the rules that you want to delete and click the ![Delete](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3471333061/p170205.png) icon.
        2.  In the Delete Selected Rules message, click **OK**.
5.  Verify that the delete operation is successful.

    After you delete a rule, it is no longer displayed on the **Rules** page.
